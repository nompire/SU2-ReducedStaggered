This directory contains parallel code for RHMC simulations of a two-flavor reduced staggered fermion system with SU(2) gauge symmetry, including related measurements.

See RHMC/README for the main README.

Top-level directories mostly follow the MILC layout:
generic   -- Procedures common to most applications: communications, I/O, data layout, etc.
include   -- Header files for common procedures
libraries -- Single processor linear algebra routines
RHMC      -- RHMC and measurements
