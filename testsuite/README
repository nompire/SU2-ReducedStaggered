This directory provides a suite of tests for the parallel code to simulate a four-dimensional two-flavor reduced staggered fermion system with local SU(2) symmetry.

Reference input and output files are provided for the following compilation targets (which are described in ../RHMC/README):
su2_hmc
su2_eig
su2_hmc_meas

The scalar configurations loaded by each test are also provided.  The su2_phase target is tested with and without checkpointing.

The scripts scalar/run_tests and mpi/run_tests automate the process of compiling, running and checking the given target.  Each script must be run from its respective directory.  Given the argument
$ ./run_tests <tag>
the script will compile the target su2_$tag, run the su2_$tag executable using the appropriate input file in this directory, save the output to $tag.out and check for differences between this output and the reference file $tag.ref.

Currently the MPI tests are customized for the Fermilab-Cluster.  Adjusting the $makefile and $run variables at the start of mpi/run_tests may suffice to adjust the tests for other systems.

Alternately, if run_tests is run with no arguments it will test every target.

Current limitations:
Only anti-periodic temporal boundary conditions for the fermions are tested.
Only the most conservative (15-pole) rational approximation is tested.
